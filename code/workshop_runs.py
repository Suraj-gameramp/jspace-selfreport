    Sufficiency asked: does the source's residual at (l, answer slot), dropped into a
    clean run, produce the name?  It did not until layer ~32.
    Necessity asks: in the SOURCE run itself, if we overwrite the answer-slot residual
    at layer l with the CLEAN run's value (the reverse patch), does the name go away?
    A position can be necessary without being sufficient: the concept may be assembled
    from that residual plus continued attention to the injected user tokens.

    Also tests the user-turn span as a block (overwrite ALL injected user positions at
    layer l with clean values): if naming dies, late layers are still reading the
    injection from the user turn, which is the 'reinforcement' hypothesis.
